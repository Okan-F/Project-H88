In this github-page, the custom-made script for the usage of Pfam can be found. It utilisez the output-files (.gff) from Augustus-tool and converts them into .fasta-files so that Pfam can use the files.

Note, the input-file at the first row, input_file, needs to be manually changed for individual files.
